WHO?
My name is Jei Shepherd and I am a queer student at Alchemy Code Lab in Portland, OR.

WHAT? Sparkling Lotus
is a jargon maker that uses programmed words from queer culture. I will use a randomizer to shift and shuffle them into phrases. Funny and mimmicking inspirational quote structure.

WHY?
 I made this to celebrate diversity, add some humour to the stress of coding, and to learn something new.

 LIVE, LOVE, LAUGH, SPARKLE!
